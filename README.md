# -Bank-Loan-Performance-and-Credit-Risk-Analysis-Using-Customer-and-Loan-Attributes-
  This project analyzes bank loan data to identify key factors influencing loan approval and default risk. By examining customer demographics, financial details, and credit history, the study helps banks improve credit decision-making and reduce loan defaults using data-driven insights.
1. Project Title (Example)

“Bank Loan Performance and Credit Risk Analysis Using Customer and Loan Attributes”

2. Problem Statement

Banks face significant risk from loan defaults. Poor credit assessment can lead to high Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), affecting profitability and stability.
This project analyzes historical loan data to identify key factors influencing loan approval and default risk, helping banks improve credit decisions.

3. Objectives

Analyze customer demographic and financial characteristics

Identify factors affecting loan approval

Identify factors leading to loan default

Build a risk classification model

Provide data-driven recommendations to reduce default rates

4. Dataset Description

You can use:

Public datasets (Kaggle / UCI)

Simulated bank loan data

Internship/company-provided data

Typical Variables

Customer Details

Age

Gender

Education

Employment type

Annual income

Loan Details

Loan amount

Loan term

Interest rate

Loan purpose

Credit Information

Credit score

Existing loans

Debt-to-income ratio

Target Variables

Loan Status (Approved / Rejected)

Loan Outcome (Default / Non-default)

5. Methodology
Step 1: Data Cleaning

Handle missing values

Remove duplicates

Treat outliers

Encode categorical variables

Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Income vs loan amount

Credit score vs default rate

Loan purpose vs approval rate

Correlation analysis

Tools: Excel / Python / R / Power BI / Tableau

6. Statistical & Analytical Techniques

Descriptive statistics

Hypothesis testing

Correlation analysis

Chi-square test (categorical variables)

7. Predictive Modeling (Optional but Strong)

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Credit Scoring Model

Model Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

ROC-AUC

8. Key Findings (Sample)

Customers with low credit scores and high debt-to-income ratios have higher default probability

Salaried individuals show better repayment behavior than self-employed

Long loan tenure increases default risk

Higher income does not always mean lower risk

9. Business Recommendations

Introduce stricter checks for high-risk loan segments

Adjust interest rates based on risk score

Promote shorter loan tenures for risky borrowers

Enhance credit score–based approval systems

10. Conclusion

The study demonstrates that data-driven credit assessment significantly improves loan portfolio quality. Implementing predictive analytics can reduce default risk and improve bank profitability.
